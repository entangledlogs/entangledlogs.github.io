## Logs {#logs}

Average week to be honest.

1.  Maze programming:
    -   Now that I have distance, I used the distances to backtrack and create a visible solution for the maze.

2.  SICP
    -   Finally into `cons`, `car` and `cdr`. The classic box and pointer notation when learning lisp.

3.  Proofs
    -   Prove some set theory theorem using logical theorems and deduction.

4.  Dev tools
    -   Herbstluftwm has the option to create virtual monitors. I can make productive use of it. One idea is to have a dedicated monitor for terminals only. I use many terminals there is a need to constantly spawn terminals. It will be really easy after implementing this system.

5.  Graphics
    -   Unfortunately, I didn't do anything significant. I just fixed on memory reference bug in my learning Vulkan journey.

6.  Art
    -   This week was about tools and some fundamentals of painting. The concepts like edge control, brush control, and blending colors in the painting. These are the process the define digital art.
