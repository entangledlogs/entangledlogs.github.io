## Logs {#logs}

I have come a long way with this experiment. I can't believe I am in the 6th week. What I realized is that some things require more time than I allocated. One important thing I learned is that chunking shouldn't be done based only on time like 30 minutes or 1 hour. But it should also include goals for a given task. So far, I only allocated time without any goal. This didn't help. I had a proper goal and time allocation for maze programming and that part progressed a lot. As for others, there aren't many things to say about them.

1.  Maze programming:
    -   This time I learned about Wilson's algorithm and how it is used to create a maze. It modifies the random walk algorithm, but visiting the neighborhood cell and deleting the loop. This one-line summary doesn't do enough justice to the algorithm.

2.  SICP
    -   I think I answered a few more questions here. I want to move beyond this childish point. Therefore, I am thinking of ramping it up. Let's see how much bandwidth I can handle for a day!

3.  Proofs
    -   Finally made to biconditionals and conditionals. These are the most difficult concept for me to grasp. Not what they mean, but for how to break it and reason around it. I have to be careful around it.

4.  Graphics (Engine)
    -   As I am following the Vulkan tutorial I finally got to implement the staging buffer. This is where the Vulkan shines. It can stage the next frame onto the memory queue and the computer can render it.

5.  Graphics
    -   I have a QUAD!! &lt;&lt; Might write a short note on how it is an extension of the classic Möller–Trumbore intersection algorithm.

6.  Art
    -   Oof.
