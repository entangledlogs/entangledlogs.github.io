Past week, I managed to work on something. Taking small achievable action was better than not doing anything at all. I managed to pull it off using something called [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeblocking). Although I am not able to hit the maximum potential, I have done something. That is a huge win on its own. For the next week too, I will be trying this method.

Each day I allocated a specific topic that I would like to explore. This allowed me to free up the mental load of having something to do. This freedom also allowed me to focus on only one task at a time. Because of my laziness, the habit isn't easy to form. However, if I keep up this pace, I will soon be able to get into some zone. My routine is divided into 6 days of activity and one day of logging. Since I implemented the idea for this week, I couldn't manage to draw out the full potential of the task. But having something rolling is a win for me.

The way I implemented chunking is as follows:

| Day       | Task                                                                |

| Sunday    | Blogging - _I plan to summarize my week and insights in this blog._ |

Once I have the routine, I should be doing each task for at least 15 minutes a day. Even if I become inert, I can search for related contents, so I am mentally prepared to perform the task next time.

1.  Maze programming:
    -   Depending on the algorithm, each maze can have its signature and bias. (New thing I learned.)

2.  SICP
    -   Just did a basic exercise. The idea of breaking things into an amendable API is out there. Yet many do not try to implement this simple idea. This approach allows to break complex tasks into smaller bits and working on those smaller bits.

3.  Proofs
    -   Going through "How to prove it." Understanding proofs allows us to devise methods and algorithms that can be implemented using simple programs. These programs are bound to be sound and reliable. So, keep going through the book.
    -   I also tried a theorem prover like _lean_. I was left in awe when I used it for the first time. Pretty cool application.

4.  Dev tools
    -   I am trying to create a minimum _Neovim_ configuration that doesn't require any plugin to operate. Since I am satisfied with _Doom Emacs_, I am configuring a minimal setup of _Neovim_ for editing scripts. I do not want to leave the comfort that _Doom Emacs_ provides.  As far as editing and project management go, I like this experience!

5.  Graphics
    -   As for graphics, I finally found a few links to do real-time cloud rendering. I have a plan to implement it.

6.  Art
    -   Just doing some basic color study. I managed to create a good shading. Quite proud of it.

It is quite surprising that even the little things I do, add up into a huge list!
