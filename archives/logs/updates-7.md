## Logs {#logs}

This week's log is going to be a bit different. After experimenting with time blocking for a while, I found it is effective when I had some well-defined objective. However, if I didn't have clear goals, blocking wasn't as effective as it should be. I even skipped some of these tasks.

Another lesson I learned after experimenting with chunking is that some tasks require deliberate effort and deep long sessions. Instead of dividing the one task over multiple weeks, it might be better to have a long session twice a week. As a result, I will be rescheduling the previous task.

The idea here will be to have a defined objective for a given week and arrange tasks accordingly. I will be implementing this new method starting on the 1st of August. It will help me address my situation and priorities.

Now with that said, there wasn't much update last week. I was working on creating a custom keyboard and ended up burning my PCB.
