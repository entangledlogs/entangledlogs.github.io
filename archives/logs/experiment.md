## Experiment {#experiment}


### Context {#context}

The past month has been quite a ride for me. I am finally free from all the courses I have to take in academic life. Now that is out of the equation, I can finally focus on things I want to focus on. Being someone from an engineering and science background, CS is a niche field. I like to think of CS as a form of applied mathematics. There are plenty of things one can learn in CS.  As for myself, I have been learning them on my own too.

As I learn more about this field, about how people build software, and how this field impacts us in daily life, I am drawn more into it. It has become quite addicting to not pass a day without trying some random thing in CS. I try different things just to explore them because I enjoy them. But the issue here is the amount of time I spent doing these random things and the amount I spend documenting these is often less. A realization that occurred to me is that if I do not write these things, I tend to forget them.

Somewhere in the HackerNews, I read the following comment:

> Do not document your code. Instead, code your document.

Thanks to the commenter who mentioned it was originally from his professor. That the professor knew something about software to make this comment.

As age kicks in, we are more prone to error and our memories aren't reliable at
all. We forget most things and it would be best to have a habit to know
some of these things. Even though most of our actions go undocumented,
I believe it is worth documenting the information we learn one way or another.
Therefore, I am trying to run a personal experiment.


### The experiment {#the-experiment}

-   Each day during work, try to note the learned information on some piece of
    paper or plain text.
-   Somewhere during the night before bed, try to find a 30 to 45 min period to document these.
-   When documenting the information, make it very raw.
-   Finally, on the weekend, go through these documents and make a post about them.


### Reasons {#reasons}

Since it is difficult to contain the information that I keep learning over my days, I wanted to find a means to document the materials that I think are important. I do not have the habit of documenting things because I rarely look back at them. But life happens and there will come situations where I will have to refresh these things again (It already came multiple times). Even during this second rereading phase, it is worthy of having some documents alongside. It helps me fill up the gap and retain important bits of information.

Even if I have to go through the source for the 10th time, having 10 iterations of the knowledge base means I went through 10 different experiences of reading the same material or content. Therefore, I am looking forward to this experiment.
