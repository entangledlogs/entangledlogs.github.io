## Logs {#logs}

Last week I had a vacation. Therefore, it was a pretty lazy week. I could have done more of these tasks, instead, I just slowed down and relaxed a bit. The good part was that I went hiking to Eltz castle! The trail is beautiful. Highly recommend it to anyone who is living in that area.

1.  Maze programming:
    -   Nothing remarkable this week. I implemented the sidewinder algorithm and called it a day.
        It was a short session that took only 20 minutes.

2.  SICP
    -   I started the exercise with interval arithmetic. So glossed on these exercises. The exercise was pretty repetitive too. It was just constructing objects using the cons cell.

3.  Proofs
    -   Finally worked on using basic laws to prove a few propositional logic.

4.  Dev tools
    -   Tweaked my window manager. I wrote a wrapper program that gives terminals a unique name.

5.  Graphics
    -   I was able to implement spherical environment mapping.
        The idea is pretty simple. Convert a 3D cartesian coordinate into a 2D point on the surface of a unit sphere. Since the ray hits that infinity, it is the same as using the ray direction vector and mapping it into the point on the surface.

6.  Art
    -   Learnt a bunch of theories on colors and lights. I haven't drawn anything yet. From next time it will be more drawing and less viewing.
