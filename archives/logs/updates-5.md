## Logs {#logs}

I don't know what is happening, but as the deadline for the internship approaches, I have been getting lazier day after day. Therefore, this week, I didn't do much of what I planned to do.

1.  Maze programming:
    -   I implemented one of the simplest forms of algorithm that can create an unbiased maze. It uses some randomization to create these kinds of mazes. The algorithm is straight forwards.

2.  SICP
    -   I only did one question for this week. A single question. At this point, I doubt why I was even doing these exercises. I want to get to the part where I can build a simple interpreter, but is it necessary? Doubtful.

3.  Proofs
    -   Skipped proving at all.

4.  Dev tools
    -   I think I will stop exploring these days for tools and find something else to do here. I think I can do some graphics-related paper implementation. I will read a paper and try to replicate it. So I will start with a simple animation-based paper. Even if it requires building multiple tools, I will do it.

5.  Graphics
    -   Skipped this week.

6.  Art
    -   I tried to create a scene. I blocked the basic colors as well as shadows and highlights. Surprisingly, I learned to pick a nice set of colors for the scene.
