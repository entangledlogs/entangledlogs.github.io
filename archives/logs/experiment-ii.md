Last month, I decided I will be tracking what I learn and create a blog post every weekend. But that is quite a challenging task. In this post, I am trying to reflect why that happened.


## Why aren't there any posts? {#why-aren-t-there-any-posts}

1.  The reason: I forget to track things!
2.  If I am tracking things, it means I am not doing my work. If I am not doing my work, it won't help me get things done.
3.  Surprisingly, it is really difficult to track things. I will have to come up with better solution to do it.


## How can I move forward with my experiment then? {#how-can-i-move-forward-with-my-experiment-then}

1.  Find a better way to track things.
2.  Try time blocking.
3.  Instead of doing nothing after work, try to make chilling time, where I will refresh the things I did.


## Planning is easy, but executing is hard? {#planning-is-easy-but-executing-is-hard}

1.  The reason: My personal motivation to do anything once I am out of work. Simply put,  it becomes arduous to find motivation to pursue further.
2.  I do not want to see more screens after seeing the screen all day.
3.  I am thinking of using pen and paper approach but all the materials I want to access do not have physical copy.
