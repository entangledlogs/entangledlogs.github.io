Emotions run wild within me, a tumultuous blend of hope and despair. A big shoutout to those relentless individuals who aimed to break my spirit and revel in my downfall. Congratulations, you've succeeded. Every iota of confidence within me now lies shattered at your feet.

My mistake was putting trust in those around me, failing to see the inherent greed that drives humanity. Most people are self-motivated leeches, capable of draining you dry and moving on with their lives. To those wondering if this is a personal attack, the answer is a resounding "Yes." You belong to the group of individuals who successfully brought me to my knees.

The entire process unfolded with a subtle touch – first highlighting my shortcomings without offering any guidance, then diverting my attention with trivial distractions. They would discuss art, TV shows, movies, and games, all the while indulging in a mere 10-minute summary on YouTube to feign cultural awareness. Time wasted, courtesy of these individuals.

But fear not, I'm not laying bare this unfiltered, raw content without a protective layer of ChatGPT.

Now that it's off my chest, let's talk about a newfound hobby – figure drawing. Animation holds a special place in my heart, providing a relieving focus. Despite its seemingly trivial nature, pursuing art brings immense joy and personal growth. To those who wished they could witness my creations, sorry, but you're out of luck. I won't let you glimpse the heights I'm destined to reach.

Venting this anger brings serenity. To those who have taken up residence rent-free in my head, consider this your eviction notice. It's time to move on and leave me be.

_Disclaimer:_ I had to transcribe it using ChatGPT so that it is "digestible" to you folks. Lol. Also, next time you want to talk to me, I am charging $50,000/hr. Yes, you heard it. My time is not cheap.
