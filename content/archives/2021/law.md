## [Sturgeon's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) {#sturgeon-s-law}

Today I learned about this revelation from this [blogpost](https://matt-rickard.com/90-of-everything-is-crap). This was quite interesting how the author mentioned that anyone can be correct by mentioning something is correct. It's because 90% of the time, they are correct 100%.

As the author suggests finding that 10% is quite a difficult task, I want this blog to belong to 10% that will feature some insightful information, ideas, and experience. The only sad part is I am not writing that often as I thought I would.
